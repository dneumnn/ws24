    "## Drawing Conclusion by Analogy \n",
    "Analogy is a special kind of similarity. Two situations are analogous if they share a common pattern of relationships among their constituent elements even though the elements themselves differ across the two situations. Typically, one analog, termed the source or base, is more familiar or better understood than the second analog, termed the target. This asymmetry in initial knowledge provides the basis for analogical transfer, using the source to generate inferences about the target.\n",

Since there are 5 shelves and each shelf can hold 3 books, the total number of arrangements is 5^3 = 125. The probability that a specific book will be placed on the top shelf is 1/125.\n",

       "A: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of combinations of choosing 5 loaves from a total of 30 loaves (15 white + 15 whole wheat). The formula for combinations is nCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items being chosen. In this case, n=30 and r=5. So, the number of ways to choose 5 loaves is 30C5 = 142,506.\n",

Since each friend should get an equal number of candies, we can divide the total number of candies by the number of friends. In this case, 48/8 = 6.
