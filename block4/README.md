### Natural Language Embedded Programs (NLEPs)

NLEP involves prompting a language model to create and execute a Python program to solve a userâ€™s query, and then output the solution as natural language.

### Program of Thoughts

PoT prompting has the LLM generate reasoning steps as programming language statements,  which are then executed by an external interpreter like Python.

While Chain-of-Thought uses LLMs for both reasoning and computation, PoT uses LLMs only for reasoning, but instead of using plain text for computations, it leverages code.
