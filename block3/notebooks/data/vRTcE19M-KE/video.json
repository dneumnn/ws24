   "title": "\"Stanford Webinar - Large Language Models Get the Hype, but Compound Systems Are the Future of AI\"",
   "description": "\"In recent years AI has taken center stage with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) that can be used to perform a wide range of tasks, from question answering to coding. There is now a strong focus on large pretrained foundation models as the core of AI application development. But on their own, these models don\u2019t do much besides taking up significant disk space\u2014it\u2019s only when they\u2019re embedded within larger systems that they start to deliver state-of-the-art results.\\n\\nIn this webinar, Professor Christopher Potts will discuss how AI systems built with multiple interacting components can achieve superior results compared to standalone models. He will also examine how this systems approach impacts AI research, product development, safety, and regulation.\\n\\nLearn more about the AI Professional Program: https://online.stanford.edu/programs/artificial-intelligence-professional-program\"",
